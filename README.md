# Icosahedron-Game

An Icosahedron has 20 sides (each of which is an equilateral triangle). Suppose you have an icosahedraldie with the numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , 20 printed on its sides. If you roll such a die then it will rest on a unique triangle that is facing down, and that triangle has a unique triangle which is the opposite faceâ€“the one facing up, the number on that triangle facing up is taken for the number showing up for that roll. Two players play a game like this:

        (1) Player A rolls the die 10 times, and computes the sum of all the 10 numbers that show up.
        (2) Player B rolls the die 10 times, and computes the sum of all the 10 numbers that show up. 
        
Whichever player gets the higher sum is the winner. In case of a tie (the sums are equal),then they play again.
